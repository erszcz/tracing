When Tidewave MCP is available, you can use the `project_eval` tool to use ExDoctor (aka `ex_doctor`) library.
ExDoctor allows for tracing Elixir function calls and message passing, as well as processing traces.
Use Tidewave `search_package_docs` tool to understand its full functionality.

When using Tidewave `project_eval` tool to call ExDoctor, you can convert traces to maps with `ExDoctor.to_map/1`.
